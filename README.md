# EICAR File Collection

A group of test documents containing combinations of macros, possibly malicious macros (auto-open), and macros containing the IECAR virus.

## Naming Convention

The general file naming structure is as follows:

type-virus-method-threat

type: [doc/xls/ppt]
virus: [clean/eicar]
method: [vba/powershell/cmd]

Additionally empty macros are marked "safe-macro"

## Usage 

The intent of these files is to send them as attachments through email, to test your custom/enterprise antivirus or spam blocking solution. Simply select the file type or virus type that you want to send and email it to yourself through your private/corporate email. 

## Safety 

These files are all safe, and implement only the EICAR test virus. However, I take no responsibility for any damage or harm you may cause in your everyday life.
